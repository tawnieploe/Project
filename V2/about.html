                <P> Main page includes links to a bio, episode, contact 
                    and merch page which are unfinished at the moment. 
                    The body includes a very brief statement about the podcast, with 2 
                    photos; one I downloaded from unsplash.com from Robert Zunikoff, the other photo 
                    is mine. There is also an ordered list with roman numerals that list what content 
                    we use for the podcast. I have also included our email address 
                    and the footer contains the podcast platforms we can be found on. </P>
                
                <p>Update May 16, 2020. I encountered some issues early on which really ate up the
                    time spent on the problem. Mistakes were made. I regret most of them because I ended up deleting
                    everything and starting over. 
                    Anyways, there are some aspects from v1 i really wanted to carry thru to v2. Mostly the creepy clown 
                    image. I added a horizontal navigation bar but it seems to have disappeared somewhere along the way. 
                    The photos added to v2 are my own. There were a lot of things that do not flow nicely 
                    that i am not happy about. Overall my entire page looks super unfinished. I couldn't get the gradiant
                    to work. I couldn't get the grid to work. I didn't do the overflow because at the moment I don't think it 
                    applies, however I could be very wrong. Most, if not all of my pages are linked and have atleast a 
                    black background as of now. I plan to continue to work on it this coming week to fix errors and 
                    get stuff to work.</p>

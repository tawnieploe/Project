            <p>We are Allison and Tawnie, sisters, and hosts of the 
            Why Are You So Scared? podcast! When we were younger
            our dads carrer in the Navy brought us to his final duty
            station before retirement in Washington state. One great 
            thing about Washington is the stormy weather setting the 
            perfect atmosphere for blanket forts and scary stories.
            </p>
            <p> As we grew, so did our interest in all things creepy, scary
            and paranormal. So here we are today bringing our interest to 
            you!

    <p1>Welcome to the Why Are You So Scared podcast! We are your hosts,<br>
       Allison and Tawnie. When we were growing up our dad was in the Navy<br>
       so we moved a decent amount. Washington was our dad's final duty <br>
       station before retirement. One of the great things about Washington<br>
       is that the weather is perfect for building blanket forts and telling<br>
       scary stories! Our love for all things creepy and scary grew with us.<br>
       So, here we are. Bringing our love for all things creepy to you, our <br>
       listeners! Join us as we bring you a new episode every Wednesday as we <br>
       share scary stories, their origins or why exactly we are so scared!</p1>

<p1>Growing up I loved hearing stories that would keep me up at night.
My love for all things creepy has grown with me and I find that I am
constantly looking for the next scary story or the next movie that will keep
me up at night.
I recently moved back home to Washington with my husband and our 3 Kids
upon his retirement from the ARMY. I am a full time student working on
my business degree.</p1>

  <p1>From a young age I have always been interested in creepy stories and folklore.
  Stories that leave you hanging or have a twist in the end, whether they are true
or not, no one knows. All I care about is it gives you the chills.
I have 3 kids and work as a nurse and a nursing instructor. While I work in
a world surrounded by evidence and science, I am also surrounded by a
world of miracles and things that have no explanations.</p1>

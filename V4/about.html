    <P> Main page includes links to a bio, episode, contact 
      and merch page which are unfinished at the moment. 
      The body includes a very brief statement about the podcast, with 2 
      photos; one I downloaded from unsplash.com from Robert Zunikoff, the other photo 
      is mine. There is also an ordered list with roman numerals that list what content 
      we use for the podcast. I have also included our email address 
      and the footer contains the podcast platforms we can be found on. </P>

    <div class="accordion-title"><span>V2</span></div>
    <div class="accordion-content">May 16,2020</div> 
    <p> Update May 16, 2020. I encountered some issues early on which really ate up the
      time spent on the problem. Mistakes were made. I regret most of them because I ended up deleting
      everything and starting over. Anyways, there are some aspects from v1 i really wanted to carry thru to v2. Mostly the creepy clown 
      image. I added a horizontal navigation bar but it seems to have disappeared somewhere along the way. 
      The photos added to v2 are my own. There were a lot of things that do not flow nicely 
      that i am not happy about. Overall my entire page looks super unfinished. I couldn't get the gradiant
      to work. I couldn't get the grid to work. I didn't do the overflow because at the moment I don't think it 
      applies, however I could be very wrong. Most, if not all of my pages are linked and have atleast a 
      black background as of now.</p>
   <input type="radio" name="select" class="accordion-select" />
    <div class="accordion-title"><span>V3</span></div>
    <div class="accordion-content">May 30,2020</div> 
    <p>I have spent the last 2 weeks working on my website to ensure the requirements from V2 were completed as 
      as well as working to make my site how I want it to look. I still have some work to do but I am very pleased
      with how it looks right now. I added a table on the listeners page to show the demographics of our audience. 
      I also added the an expanding/ contracting box on my about page, which you are seeing to read this. I don't 
      think I did the page formating right for devices. I had a lot of trouble trying to add a dropdown menu 
      and eventually the exanding text boxes. It required a lot of youtube video tutorials and reading on other
      websites. Everything I tried didn't seem to work or it would throw off the formatting I already had. This 
      worked, so I kept it. 
    </p>
    <input type="radio" name="select" class="accordion-select" />
    <div class="accordion-title"><span>V4</span></div>
    <div class="accordion-content">June 15, 2020</div>
    <p>For my V4 I really went through and cleaned up the things that were bothering me. I tried to simplify the website 
      so it wouldn't be too messy. I linked an email, I added a form, which for some reason i was unable to enlarge but 
      I am content with it. I added an iframe element to my about page, so if you are reading thism enjoy!
      The i frame element is a youtube video of creepy music. I couldn't get the podcast
      promo I recrrded to upload, I tried many different ways but it would not work. I also updated my table info 
      for location of listeners. I am super happy with how my site turned out!
